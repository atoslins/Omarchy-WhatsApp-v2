# Privacy and local data

OmaWhatsApp handles end-to-end encrypted data after it reaches your linked
device. Treat wacli's database and media directory as private.

Never commit WhatsApp session keys, `wacli.db`, `session.db`, WAL/SHM files,
media downloads, chat/message identifiers, phone numbers, exports, or real
conversation screenshots. Repository ignore rules help, but every staged diff
must still be reviewed before push.

Runtime data remains under `~/.local/state/`. Clipboard images use a private
runtime file, pass through wacli, and are removed in a `finally` path.
OmaWhatsApp's mode-`0600` preferences contain the bar badge visibility, the
dropdown density, and the desktop-notification choice, plus one private section
per account store holding that account's offline choice,
automatic-reading choice, local notification acknowledgements, and the
per-chat watermark that decides which popups are still owed. Accounts never
read each other's section, so the same contact reachable from two linked
phones keeps two independent local badges. State reads and locks are descriptor-bound,
owner-checked, and no-follow; atomic replacement never follows a predictable
state-file symlink. They never leave the machine and are never written into
wacli's database.

Marking a chat read, automatically or from the chat list, sends WhatsApp an
app-state change that syncs the read state to the user's own devices. wacli
has no path that sends a read receipt, so the other side is not told.

Desktop popups leave the process: chat names, senders, and message previews
reach the notification daemon and its history. They are off by default, the
preview can be dropped so only chat names travel, and every field is truncated
to one printable, markup-inert line before it is handed to `notify-send`.

Voice drafts are created under the mode-`0700`
`~/.local/state/omawhatsapp/voice-drafts` directory and finalized to mode
`0600`. They never leave the device during recording or preview. Capture opens
only after an explicit UI action, stops before review, and crosses WhatsApp
only after the user explicitly submits the reviewed draft. Failed sends remain
local for retry or discard; confirmed sends remove their draft.

Profile-photo refresh is an explicit remote read, never part of ordinary chat
browsing. The helper accepts only public, hostname-verified HTTPS targets,
pins each connection to the address it validated, and repeats that boundary at
every redirect. It keeps at most 128 one-megabyte JPEG, PNG, or WebP files in
an owner-private cache with opaque names. CDN URLs, query tokens, account store
paths, and chat identifiers are not stored in that index or exposed to QML;
the UI receives only a validated absolute local path.

If a foreground wacli operation briefly yields background sync, the helper
stores a crash-recovery intent containing only the public systemd unit name and
an opaque lock filename. It contains no account store path, chat identifier,
message, media, URL, or credential and is removed after sync is restored.

Child-process and clipboard pipes are drained incrementally under hard byte
caps. Chat names, senders, message bodies, filenames, button labels, and error
strings are always rendered as plain text in QML.

The shipped agent skill contains instructions only—no account, chat, message,
or media data. Its advanced gateway does not echo command arguments, because
they may contain phone numbers, JIDs, message text, filenames, invite codes,
locations, webhook destinations, or profile values. Agents must keep local
results, exports, event streams, downloaded media, and webhook secrets out of
repositories, issues, screenshots, and durable logs, and must use the helper
rather than touching a WhatsApp database directly.

For screenshots, open `omawhatsapp` with `{"demo":true}`. Demo mode contains
repository-owned sample data and performs no WhatsApp writes.
