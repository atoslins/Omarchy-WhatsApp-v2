# Multi-account scope map

Working document for adding multiple WhatsApp accounts to OmaWhatsApp, and for
landing the desktop-notification work that currently exists only on one
machine. It records what has to change, where, and in what order. It is not an
implementation.

## Starting position

wacli 0.17.1 already supports named accounts. `--account NAME` is a global flag
on every leaf, and `accounts add|list|remove|show|use` manage `config.yaml`.
Verified against 0.17.1 in a throwaway `XDG_STATE_HOME`:

```json
{"accounts": [{"name": "probe", "configured_store": "accounts/probe",
               "store_dir": "/…/wacli/accounts/probe", "default": true}],
 "config_path": "/…/wacli/config.yaml", "default_account": "probe"}
```

Three properties matter for this work:

- `accounts list` already resolves `store_dir` to an absolute path, so the
  helper reads store locations straight from it and never has to guess a layout
  or run `doctor` per account. The default layout is `<state>/wacli/accounts/<name>`.
- `configured_store` accepts `.`, which resolves to the root store. Earlier
  releases documented that as a manual migration path; 0.11 instead leaves
  the root store and upstream config untouched and scopes it with `--store`.
- `--store` does not redirect the account config: `config_path` stays in the
  XDG state directory no matter what `--store` says. The two are parallel ways
  to pick a store, never a way to sandbox `config.yaml`.

One migration hazard follows from this: the first named account added becomes
`default_account`, so plain `wacli` commands stop pointing at the root store.
OmaWhatsApp avoids owning wacli's YAML contract: it discovers that still-linked
root session as `primary`, scopes it with `--store`, and keeps the original
root-store-pinned sync unit alongside named-account template units.

OmaWhatsApp assumes a single implicit account everywhere:

- `bin/omawhatsapp` builds `Backend` from one `STORE_DIR`, one `STATE_DIR`, one
  `wacli.db`, and never passes `--account` on the commands it runs itself.
- Local state under `~/.local/state/omawhatsapp/` is keyed by bare JID:
  `acknowledged_unread`, `sent-media.json`, and (with the notification patch)
  `notified`. The same contact or group reachable from two accounts collides on
  one key.
- `systemd/user/wacli-sync.service` is one unit for one store, and
  `set_online`, `_mutate`, `transport_interactive`, and `auth` all start and
  stop that fixed unit name.
- `Service.qml` watches one store directory with one `inotifywait`, keeps one
  `selectedChatJid`, and sends every helper payload without an account field.

### The unversioned notification patch

Desktop notifications exist on this machine only. They live in the installed
copies (`~/.local/bin/omawhatsapp`, `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/omawhatsapp/`,
manifest `0.7.0`) and were written against `47eaee6`, five commits behind
`main`. They were never committed and were never reinstalled after the
`b3948e9`/`1487456`/`70465c0`/`97ac672` work landed, so the machine is running
older code than the repository in every other respect.

What the patch adds: `NOTIFY_SEND` plus bounded `MAX_NOTIFY_*` limits, a
`notifications: {enabled, preview}` preference, a `notified` watermark map,
`notify` and `notify-mode` commands, markup-inert summary/body sanitising,
`last_sender` in the chat query, a `notify_available` field on `status`, a
`runNotify()` tick and `notifyProcess` in `Service.qml`, and a quiet/notify
pill in the `App.qml` header.

Porting it forward is prerequisite work, not part of multi-account: `main` has
since changed `_preferences` (`send_read_receipts`, `show_unread_count`,
`dropdown_rows`) and `status`, which is exactly where the patch touches.

## Decisions taken

- **Unified rail.** One merged chat list across all accounts, each row tagged
  with its account. The bar badge sums every account.
- **Notifications are independent of the badge.** A popup must still fire when
  `show_unread_count` is false, when the window and dropdown are closed, and
  when WhatsApp reports `unread = 0` but the chat timestamp advanced (read on
  the phone, or with automatic reading off).
- **Archived and muted keep suppressing.** No change to that filter.

## Scope by layer

### 1. Helper account resolution (`bin/omawhatsapp`)

- Introduce an account record (name, label, store dir, state namespace) and a
  resolver that reads `accounts list` once per request and fills each store dir
  from that account's `doctor`. The unnamed legacy account (no entry in
  `config.yaml`, default store) has to keep working as an implicit account, so
  the resolver returns it when the account list is empty.
- Thread the account through `_run`, `_mutate`, `_write`, `_doctor`,
  `_database`, and `_connect`. Today none of them can name an account.
- Every chat-scoped entry point gains an account argument and resolves its JID
  against that account's mirror: `_chat`, `_chat_any`, `messages`, `members`,
  `download_media`, `send`, `send_file`, `send_files`, `send_sticker`,
  `send_poll`, `react`, `edit_message`, `delete_message`, `forward_message`,
  `select_option`, `chat_action`, `paste`. This is the exact-chat boundary from
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`; resolving against the wrong store would silently widen it.
- `chats()` becomes N bounded queries plus an in-memory merge on
  `pinned DESC, timestamp DESC, name`, re-limited after the merge, with
  `account` and `account_label` on every row.
- `status()` returns a per-account array (authenticated, sync active, online,
  database ready, error) plus the aggregate the bar needs.

### 2. Helper local state

- Namespace `acknowledged_unread`, `notified`, and `sent-media.json` by
  account. `_media_hint_key` must include the account alongside JID and message
  ID.
- Split the preference set: `dropdown_rows` and `show_unread_count` stay
  global; `online` and `send_read_receipts` become per account, since `online`
  maps to a systemd unit that is now per account.
- Bump `PREFERENCES_VERSION` to 2 and migrate v1 in place, moving existing maps
  under the default account. The live file on this machine already carries 9
  acknowledgements and 500 watermarks, so a silent reset would replay or lose
  real state.

### 3. Background sync and the store lock

- Replace `wacli-sync.service` with a `wacli-sync@.service` template
  instantiated per account, with `ConditionPathExists` and `ReadWritePaths`
  derived from that account's store.
- `_sync_active`, `set_online`, `auth`, and the lock-contention fallback in
  `_mutate` must operate on one instance name. The fallback currently stops
  *the* sync unit; with several accounts it must stop only the unit that owns
  the contended store, or a send on one account interrupts sync on the others.
  `LOCK`, `HEARTBEAT`, and `.send.sock` are per store, so the contention itself
  stays per account.
- `scripts/install` installs and restarts the template, migrates an enabled
  legacy unit, and `scripts/uninstall` disables every instance. `scripts/test`
  greps for the literal `systemctl --user restart wacli-sync.service`, so that
  guard changes with the unit. Per `CLAUDE.md`, verify the unit with
  `systemd-analyze verify` before committing it.

### 4. Agent gateway (`transport`)

- `_transport_globals` and `transport_interactive` already accept and validate
  `--account` / `--store`, and `WACLI_OPERATION_POLICIES` already classifies
  `accounts add|list|remove|show|use`. No new authorization surface is needed.
- Latent bug to fix as part of this work: `_validate_transport_targets` calls
  `self._chat_any(...)` and therefore validates a `--to` JID against the
  default store even when the request names another account. Under one account
  it is invisible; under two it validates the wrong mirror.
- `transport_interactive` stops and restarts the fixed unit name around `auth`
  and `sync`; it must use the instance for the requested account.

### 5. QML surfaces

- `Service.qml`: chat rows carry `account`; the selection becomes an
  (account, JID) pair and every `runWrite` payload carries it; one store
  watcher per account (or one `inotifywait` over several paths) feeding the
  existing debounce; `notificationUnreadCount` already reduces over rows and
  aggregates for free.
- `Dropdown.qml` and `App.qml`: per-row account marker, optional per-account
  filter, account switcher in the header, and demo-mode fixtures with two
  accounts so the privacy-safe capture still represents the feature.
- `BarWidget.qml`: no structural change; badge and tooltip already derive from
  the aggregate.
- `IpcHandler.openApp` payload accepts an account so bindings can target one.

### 6. Notifications, ported and made per account

- Port the patch onto `main` first (conflicts expected in `_preferences` and
  `status`), commit it, reinstall, and only then extend it.
- `notified` moves under the account namespace, and seeding stays per account:
  adding a second account must not replay its entire archive as popups.
- One `notify` pass sweeps all accounts. `MAX_NOTIFY_BURST` stays a global cap
  with a single overflow summary, otherwise N accounts means N times five
  popups in one tick.
- The popup summary gains the account label when more than one account is
  configured, in both preview and names-only modes.
- The three decided behaviours need explicit tests, because two of them are
  properties of code that does not exist yet on `main`:
  - `unread = 0` with an advanced timestamp still notifies (already in the
    patch as `max(1, arrived) if unread > 0 else 1`),
  - `show_unread_count = false` hides the bar badge and does not suppress the
    popup,
  - a closed window and closed dropdown do not suppress; only the visible chat
    does, and that skip becomes an (account, JID) pair.
- `notify_available` stays global: it only reports whether `notify-send` exists.

### 7. Tests and docs

- `tests/test_backend.py` builds one temporary SQLite store. It needs a
  two-store fixture with a fake account config, covering: rail merge and
  ordering, isolation of an identical JID across accounts, `--account` present
  on each generated wacli command, the gateway exact-chat guard resolving in
  the right store, per-account notify behaviour, and the v1 to v2 preference
  migration.
- `scripts/check-wacli-parity` needs no change; parity already covers the
  `accounts` leaves.
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lifetimes, data boundary), `docs/TECHNICAL.md`,
  `docs/PRIVACY.md` (per-account state), `docs/TESTING.md`, `README.md`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Open questions and risks

- The systemd template still needs a real second account to confirm what
  `ReadWritePaths` should cover: every account store under one root, or one
  path per instance when an account points somewhere else entirely.
- Cost of N SQLite connections and N inotify watchers in the resident service,
  against the current single-store budget in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Machine and repository have diverged. Reinstalling `main` today would drop
  working notifications; committing the port is what makes the two agree again.

## Delivered

All five steps landed in 0.9.0 and 0.10.0:

0. The notification patch was ported onto `main`, tested, and released as
   0.9.0. Repository and machine agree again.
1. The helper resolves accounts from `accounts list`, scopes every command,
   mirror, and unit to one of them, merges the rail, keys state by store, and
   migrates version 1 preferences into the default account.
2. `wacli-sync@.service` runs one instance per account, gated by the helper's
   `session-ready`, with the installer and uninstaller following.
3. The rail, selection, drafts, forwarding, badge, header, and store watchers
   are account aware, with the shared rules in `AccountModel.js` under
   offscreen tests, and demo mode showing two accounts.
4. One notification pass sweeps every account under a shared burst cap and
   names the account when more than one is linked.
5. Architecture, technical, privacy, testing, README, skill, and changelog
   notes describe the account boundary.
6. Version 0.11 adds one-click account filters/linking while preserving an
   existing root session as synthetic `primary`; no wacli config is rewritten.

## Verified against two real accounts

Two linked phones were run side by side: the original session, registered with
`store: .`, plus a second account added afterwards. The merged rail ordered
both accounts correctly, the badge aggregated, and the new account adopted its
watermark silently instead of replaying its history as popups. Several chats
were reachable from both phones, and each kept its own local state, which is
what keying state by store rather than by account name buys.

That run also found two defects a single account could never surface:

- `status` aggregated `sync_active`, so the header pill claimed "online" for an
  account whose own sync was down while a sibling account synced. Readiness
  stays aggregated; anything a surface describes is now per account.
- The sync units treated a held store lock as a failure and restarted every ten
  seconds. A foreground `accounts add` bootstrapping history holds that lock for
  as long as the history takes, so the unit failed and restarted for as long as
  the bootstrap ran. `--lock-wait` makes the unit wait inside the process and
  start the moment the lock frees.

Passing `--lock-wait` on the helper's own writes was considered and rejected:
`sync --follow` holds the store lock continuously, so a write that is not
delegated to its companion socket will always collide, and waiting would only
add latency before the unavoidable pause-write-restart fallback.

## Still open

- An account whose store lives outside wacli's state directory needs a systemd
  drop-in adding that path to `ReadWritePaths`. The template documents it
  rather than guessing.
- The rail stays merged and the open chat decides the account; the account
  chips above it filter the rail to one account.

## Day to day with several accounts (2026-09-25)

A survey of what gets in the way once more than one phone is linked, ranked
by how often it bites:

1. **One account cannot be quieted.** Notifications were all or nothing.
   Delivered: Settings → Accounts has a Notifications switch per account. A
   muted account still advances its watermark, so turning it back on does not
   replay what arrived meanwhile.
2. **Sync was per account in the helper but not on screen.** Only the open
   chat's account could be paused. Delivered: each account card has its own
   Background sync switch.
3. **No way to unlink.** Removing a linked device meant the terminal.
   Delivered: Unlink on the card, which asks first and names the account; the
   helper refuses unless the confirmation carries the name, logs the device
   out, drops a named account from wacli's config and keeps the local
   archive.
4. **Which account is this chat?** Only a text prefix told. Delivered: each
   account has a color, in configured order (the first is the theme accent),
   shown as a bar on the row's edge in the list and the dropdown, on the
   account chips and on the account name in the header. It is not a dot on
   the photo, where it would read as "online".
5. **Forwarding stays inside one account.** The forward dialog only offers
   chats of the message's own account (`App.qml`, `toggleForwardTarget`).
   Next candidate: forwarding to another account's chat means downloading the
   media and sending it again from that account, since WhatsApp forwards only
   within a session.
6. **New chat uses the account the helper serves.** The dialog names it but
   does not let you choose. Candidate after forwarding: an account choice in
   the dialog when more than one is linked.
